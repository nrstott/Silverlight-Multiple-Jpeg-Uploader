This project isn't complete yet.  I could use some assistance on the Silverlight end. 

References:
This project uses a version of SharpZipLib.
Originally from SharpDevelop but ported to Silverlight.  http://www.codeplex.com/slsharpziplib

Also uses FJ.Core for jpeg resizing


I intend to make the server end compatible with the "Silverlight File Upload"
http://silverlightfileupld.codeplex.com/

 Currently the project resizes and zips all with code that is safe for silverlight assemblies.
 
 Ultimately I would like to have a very simple UI with a processing gif (during the resize and zip phase).
 
 Then a mac like progress bar during the upload.
 
 Their should be two buttons one with "Browse files" and one with "Upload files".  
 I considered the ability to do this all asynch but then doing the single progress bar becomes a battle so I dismissed it.  
 
 I think it will make up for non-asynch with the single post and the good UI.
